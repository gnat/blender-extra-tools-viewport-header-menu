# 🧊 Extra Tools for Viewport Header Menu

Blender 3D add-on for more tools in the 3D Viewport header menu.

Inspired by Blender for Artists (bforartists)

## Why does this exist?

We all love Blender for Artists (bforartists) but it can be a bit big and behind mainline Blender. Here's some of the main conveniences seperated out in a zero dependency add-on package for the latest Blender versions.

Adds convenience buttons in the 3D Viewport for:

* Common views (Front, Top, Bottom, Left, Right, Back)
* Undo / Redo
* Import / Export
* Global Search
